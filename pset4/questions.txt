0.  JPEG: 16777216 (256^3), BMP: 16777216, PNG 281474976710656, GIF 256
1.  GIF supports animation
2.  Lossy changes some of the pixels to significantly reduce the size of the file, but results in lower image quality
3.  JPEG is lossy, but has a lossless standard that is not widely implemented
4.  Changes the name of the file and lists the sectors as free
5.  Overwrite each bit with random bits
6.  stdint.h is a standard C library that allows strict definition of int data type sizes. Useful for embedded programming
7.  To define specific ranges that are allowed; Portability and clarity
8.  BYTE 8; DWORD 32; LONG 32; WORD 16;
9.  bmp file header magic number: 0x424d or "BM" in ascii, but may not be represented that way in binary due to "endianess" of the cpu
10. bisize is the number of bytes required by the structure so you know what the offsets are for the start of the image; bfsize is the bmp file size
11. It describes the way the pixels are indexed, negative means the origin is in the bottom left of the image
12. biBitCount
13. If for some reason the output file couldn't be created (lack of space or other unknown reason)
14. We want to parse through each element in the data structure one at a time. the combination of sizeof() and 1 allow that. 1 is how many elements of size sizeof should fread return
15. Because 3 pixels x 3 bytes each is 9. 9 is not a multiple of 4 which is required by the BMP specification
16. fseek() moves the cursor (file position indicator) a certain number of bytes
17. SEEK_CUR is a pointer to the current position in the file. A required argument in the fseek() function to determine from where to offset
18. The infamous Mr. Astley
