#Edx Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science CS50

#Problem set 1

Practice simple flow control, mathematical operations, and I/O with C. Details [HERE](http://cdn.cs50.net/2015/fall/psets/1/pset1/pset1.html)

## mario

Draw a pyramid with the pound (#) symbol in std out.

## greedy

Devise algorithm to compute change using the fewest coins possible.

## water

Calculate the number of water bottles needed to take a shower of certain length.

#Problem set 2

Introduce new data types including chars and arrays, learn more about strings, and learn how to write programs that accept command-line arguments. Details [HERE](http://cdn.cs50.net/2015/fall/psets/2/pset2/pset2.html)

## Initials

Output the capitalized initials of a name passed as an argument.

## Caesar

Implement a [Caesar cipher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher).


## Vigenere

Implement a [Vigenere cipher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher).

#Problem set 3

Learn about analyzing and improving the performance of algorithms. Introduce recursion. Details [HERE](http://cdn.cs50.net/2015/fall/psets/3/pset3/pset3.html)

##Find

Implement a binary search algorithm in C.

##Game of Fifteen

Implement the view and the logic behind a number sorting game, checking for illegal moves or if a "win" condition is satisfied.

#Problem set 4

Take on more advanced concepts of C, like structs, pointers, and memory management.

##Whodunit

Programmatically modify the pixel data of an image file

##Resize.c

Use a bmp file to successfully increase or decrease the size of an image. Manage header information and pixel padding to correct for "imperfect" resizes.

##Recover.c

Read the sectors of an image file to recover corrupted images and save them back to disk.

#Problem set 5

Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Tries, and Hash Tables. Learn how to write fast algorithms with these data structures.

Details [HERE](http://cdn.cs50.net/2015/fall/psets/5/pset5/pset5.html)

##Speller.c

Use either a Trie or a Hash Table to store a dictionary of words. Use that dictionary to spell check all words in a list of words. Implement load, check, size, and unload as efficiently as possible, in such a way that TIME IN load, TIME IN check, TIME IN size, and TIME IN unload are all minimized.

#Problem set 6

Detail [HERE](http://cdn.cs50.net/2015/fall/psets/6/pset6/pset6.html)

##Server.c

Complete the implementation of a server. Focus mainly on parsing requests and handling special characters.

#Problem set 7

Depart from C and begin working on web technologies. HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, MVC design pattern.

Detail [HERE](http://cdn.cs50.net/2015/fall/psets/7/pset7/pset7.html)

##Finance

Use new knowledge of MVC pattern, PHP, HTML, CSS, and database querying to create a stock trading website like [this one](https://finance.cs50.net/login.php). Additional functionality in my implementation is a user profile page.

#Problem set 8

Get into the world of public APIs, Javascript, jQuery, and ajax.

Details [HERE](http://cdn.cs50.net/2015/fall/psets/8/pset8/pset8.html)

##Mashup

Create a website that overlays local news headlines on top of a searchable, draggable map of the United States like [this one](https://mashup.cs50.net). Extra step for this project was to implement some other functionality. I added a weather report to the local news popup.
